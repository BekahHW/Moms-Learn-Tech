# MOMS LEARN TECH
Everyone's talking about the gender gap in the tech industry. There's been a large push for increasing funding for women to learn tech. Although this is a move in the right direction, it doesn't cover the challenges that moms learning tech are facing.

## CHALLENGES
 Many moms are either coming back into the tech field after spending time to raise children or are learning for the first time in order to provide for their children.

Some of the challenges moms face are:

- Time
- Costs
- Imposter Syndrome
- Reintegration into the workforce
- Breaking into a new field
- Resume gaps

Below you'll find a list of resources to help moms at all stages of their tech learning journey.
